                    <p>
                        Examples of dramatic transformation in communication
                        and commerce led by web development include e-com-
                        merce. Online auction sites such as eBay have changed
                        way consum find and
                        goods and servic-
                        es. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com
                        (among many others) have transformed the shopping
                        and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers.

                    <h2>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing
                        industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use
                        their website to sell products and services to customers.[1]
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        There is open source software for web development like BerkeleyDB, GlassFish,
                        LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of
                        learning web development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the
                        growth of the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG Web-develop-
                        ment software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, Blue Griffon and Microsoft Visual
                        Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming
                        languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and
                        implemented quickly with the help of help files, technical books, internet tutorials,
                        or face-to-face training.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more
                        dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver
                        applications as web services which were traditionally only available as applica-
                        tions on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to de-
                        centralize information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise
                        of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Docs. These
                        web services allow users to interact with applications from many locations,
                        instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their application environment.
